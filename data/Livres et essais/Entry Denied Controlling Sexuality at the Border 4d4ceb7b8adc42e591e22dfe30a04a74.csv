"“Between 1907 and 1908 Japan and the United States negotiated the Gentlemen’s Agreement, which regulated Japanese
immigration to the United States for the years to come. In response to anti-Japanese agitation, the agreement terminated
the migration of all Japanese laborers to the United States. But it allowed Japanese men who were already resident in the
United States to send for wives. Consequently, from 1908 to 1920, wives comprised a substantial proportion of Japanese
migration to the United States.”"
"“The Page Law of 1875 established “the policy of direct federal regulation of immigration by prohibiting for the first
time the entry of undesirable immigrants.”¹ Immigrants designated as undesirable were those who could be classified as
convicts, contract laborers, and Asian women coming to work in prostitution.”"
"Quatrième de couverture :"
"Lesbians, prostitutes, women likely to have sex across racial lines, ""brought to the United States for immoral purposes,""
or ""arriving in a state of pregnancy""—national threats, one and all. Since the late nineteenth century, immigrant women’s
sexuality has been viewed as a threat to national security, to be contained through strict border-monitoring practices. By
scrutinizing this policy, its origins, and its application, Eithne Luibhéid shows how the U.S. border became a site not just
for controlling female sexuality but also for contesting, constructing, and renegotiating sexual identity."
"Initially targeting Chinese women, immigration control based on sexuality rapidly expanded to encompass every woman
who sought entry to the United States. The particular cases Luibhéid examines-efforts to differentiate Chinese prostitutes
from wives, the 1920s exclusion of Japanese wives to reduce the Japanese-American birthrate, the deportation of a
Mexican woman on charges of lesbianism, the role of rape in mediating women’s border crossings today—challenge
conventional accounts that attribute exclusion solely to prejudice or lack of information. This innovative work clearly
links sexuality-based immigration exclusion to a dominant nationalism premised on sexual, gender, racial, and class
hierarchies."
