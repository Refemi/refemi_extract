"Extraits et citations :"
"“Home was a place where I was forced to conform to someone else’s image of who and what I should be. School was the
place where I could forget that self and, through ideas reinvent myself.” (pp-3)"
"“To Educate for freedom, then we have to challenge and change the way everyone thinks about the pedagogical
process.” (pp-144)"
"“Education as the practice of freedom is not just about liberatory knowledge, it is about a liberatory practice in the
classroom.” (pp-147)"
"“The classroom, with all its limitations, remains a location of possibility. In that field of possibility, we have the
opportunity to labour for freedom, to demand of ourselves and our comrades, an openness of mind and heart that allows
us to face reality even as we collectively imagine ways to move beyond boundaries, to transgress. This is education as
the practice of freedom.” (pp- 207)"
"Quatrième de couverture :"
"""After reading Teaching to Transgress I am once again struck by bell hooks's never-ending, unquiet intellectual energy,an energy that makes her radical and loving."" -- Paulo Freire"
"In Teaching to Transgress, bell hooks - writer, teacher, and insurgent black intellectual - writes about a new kind ofeducation, education as the practice of freedom. Teaching students to ""transgress"" against racial, sexual, and classboundaries in order to achieve the gift of freedom is, for hooks, the teacher's most important goal."
"bell hooks speaks to the heart of education today: how can we rethink teaching practices in the age of multiculturalism?
What do we do about teachers who do not want to teach, and students who do not want to learn? How should we deal
with racism and sexism in the classroom?"
"Full of passion and politics, Teaching to Transgress combines a practical knowledge of the classroom with a deeply feltconnection to the world of emotions and feelings. This is the rare book about teachers and students that dares to raisequestions about eros and rage, grief and reconciliation, and the future of teaching itself."
"""To educate is the practice of freedom,"" writes bell hooks, ""is a way of teaching anyone can learn."" Teachingto Transgress is the ******record of one gifted teacher's struggle to make classrooms work."
