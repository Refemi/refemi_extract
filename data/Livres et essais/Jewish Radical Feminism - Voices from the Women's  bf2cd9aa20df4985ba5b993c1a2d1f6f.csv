"Extraits et citations :"
"“In February 1973, nearly five hundred excited Jewish women packed the ballroom of the Hotel McAlpin on the corner
of Broadway and Thirty-Fourth Street in New York’s Herald Square. Built in 1912, the onceglorious McAlpin, the largest
hotel in the world at the time, had even boasted two gender-specific floors, where women could reserve a room on the
women-only floor and bypass the lobby, checking in directly at their own floor.”"
"“On May 11, 1969, Nancy Miriam Hawley stood in front of a small group of women at Emmanuel College, leading a
workshop titled “Women and Their Bodies” at Boston’s first Female Liberation Conference, which she had organized
with Roxanne Dunbar of Cell 16. Like Hawley, who had recently given birth to her second child, a number of women at
the workshop who had been involved in the New Left and the new women’s movement were having babies. “Birth
control and children were prominent issues for us,” Hawley recalled.”"
"Quatrième de couverture :"
"Fifty years after the start of the women's liberation movement, a book that at last illuminates the profound impact
Jewishness and second-wave feminism had on each other."
"Jewish women were undeniably instrumental in shaping the women's liberation movement of the 1960s, 70s, and 80s."
"Yet historians and participants themselves have overlooked their contributions as Jews. This has left many vital questions
unasked and unanswered—until now. Delving into archival sources and conducting extensive interviews with these
fierce pioneers, Joyce Antler has at last shattered the silence at the crossroads of being Jewish and feminist."
"Antler's exhilarating new book features dozens of compelling biographical narratives that reveal the struggles and
achievements of Jewish radical feminists in Chicago, NewYork and Boston, as well as those who participated in the
later, self-consciously identified Jewish feminist movement that fought gender inequities in Jewish religious and secular
life. Disproportionately represented in the movement, Jewish women's liberationists helped to provide theories and
models for radical action that were used throughout the United States and abroad. Their articles and books became
classics of the movement and led to new initiatives in academia, politics, and grassroots organizing. Other Jewish-
identified feminists brought the women's movement to the Jewish mainstream and Jewish feminism to the Left. For
many of these women, feminism in fact served as a ""portal"" into Judaism."
"Recovering this deeply hidden history, Jewish Radical Feminism places Jewish women's activism at the center offeminist and Jewish narratives. The stories of over forty women's liberationists and identified Jewish feminists—fromShulamith Firestone and Susan Brownmiller to Rabbis Laura Geller and Rebecca Alpert—illustrate how women'sliberation and Jewish feminism unfolded over the course of the lives of an extraordinary cohort of women, profoundlyinfluencing the social, political, and religious revolutions of our era."
