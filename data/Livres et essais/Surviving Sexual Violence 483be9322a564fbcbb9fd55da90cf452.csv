"Quatrième de couverture :"
"“Women's awareness of the threat and reality of sexual violence is now perhaps more than ever publicly acknowledged."
"Yet this fact continues to be almost wholly ignored. This new study, based on in-depth interviews with 60 women, is the
first to cover the experience of a range of forms of sexual violence over women's lifetimes. Drawing on feminist theory,
developing a critique of male research and quoting extensively from the women interviewed, it developes feminist
thought in several key areas: the similarities and differences between forms of sexual violence; the ways women define
their experiences; and the strategies women use in resisting, coping with and surviving sexual violence. The author
stresses the importance for all women of recognizing the incidents of sexual violence in their lives and seeing themselves
and other women as survivors rather than victims. In highlighting the ways in which the media, the criminal justice
system and even the ""helping"" profess ions contribute to the trivialization of sexual violence, she demonstrates the
necessity of women organizing collectively to end this suffering.”"
