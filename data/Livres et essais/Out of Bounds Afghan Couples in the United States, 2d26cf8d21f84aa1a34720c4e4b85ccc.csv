"""Arranged marriages are essentially like business contracts but the definition of arranged marriage differs according to
families and the degree of control they give their children in choosing their mates. Mothers usually find an available girl
compatible for their sons to marry. Then the elders in his family, who are his representatives, will propose to the girl's
family. Traditionally, the families make the final decision regarding which household their child marries into, but more
liberal parents will ask their daughters and sons for approval before proceeding with the transaction. In some cases, the
boy and the girl will be cousins and therefore, know each other very well. In other families, cousins are betrothed to each
other when they are born while in marriages among ""strangers,"" the boy might see a picture of the girl or see her in
college or a wedding. Most married couples are from the same ethnic group, religious sect and class. Afghan males and
females are considered boys and girls until they are married and then their status rises to men and women."""
"""This paper is about the approximately 60 thousand Afghan refugees who fled the war and settled in the United States. It
is about first-generation Afghan boys and girls, men and women, who bear those warnings in their soul and psyche but
are conflicted when they are thrown into an alien American"" culture. It is about the dilemmas they experience reconciling
two antagonistic worlds. It is about forming bicultural identities and the plight of expressing that duality. It is about
Afghan men and women's interaction with each other, their relationships, their marriage, and their perceptions of who
they are and who they want their children to be."""
