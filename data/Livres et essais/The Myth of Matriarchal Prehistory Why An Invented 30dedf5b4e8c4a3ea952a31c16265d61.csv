"“According to the myth of matriarchal prehistory, men and women lived together peacefully before recorded history."
"Society was centered around women, with their mysterious life-giving powers, and they were honored as incarnations
and priestesses of the Great Goddess. Then a transformation occurred, and men thereafter dominated society..."
"Given the universality of patriarchy in recorded history, this vision is understandably appealing for many women. But
does it have any basis in fact? And as a myth, does it work for the good of women?"""

"“She argues that the feminist archaeology of Marija Gimbutas had a large part in constructing a late twentieth-centuryfeminist myth of matriarchal prehistory. She questions whether Gimbutas's archaeological findings adequately supportthe claim that these societies were matriarchal or matrifocal. She says that we know of no cultures in which paternity isignored and that the sacred status of goddesses does not automatically increase female social status. Eller concludes thatinventing prehistoric ages in which women and men lived in harmony and equality ""is a burden that feminists need not,and should not bear."" In her view, the ""matriarchal myth"" tarnishes the feminist movement by leaving it open toaccusations of ""vacuousness and irrelevance that we cannot afford to court."""
"Eller's book has been criticised by feminist historian Max Dashu for ""mischaracterising"" the theories of Gimbutas and
other key anthropologists, and for labeling them as ""matriarchalist"" despite most of these scholars rejecting ideas
of matriarchy (female rulership) in favour of matrifocal or matrilineal societies. Dashu wrote that Eller ""makes no
distinction between scholarly studies in a wide range of fields and expressions of the burgeoning Goddess movement,
including novels, guided tours, market-driven enterprises.” Wikipédia"
