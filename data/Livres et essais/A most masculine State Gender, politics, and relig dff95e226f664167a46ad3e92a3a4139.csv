"“Saudi women often conjure up contradictory images. They are either excluded, heavily veiled victims of their own
religion and society, or wealthy, glamorous, cosmopolitan entrepreneurs benefiting from inherited wealth and state
education. Notwithstanding these sensational stereotypes, the 2010 Global Gender Gap Report demonstrates that Saudi
women lag behind in economic participation and political empowerment, although in health and educational attainment
they may achieve better scores. The country has a very high gender gap index, ranked at 129 out of 134. Saudi women
remain excluded from full participation in society, despite a recent increase in employment. In 2008, the unemployment
rate for women was high, reaching 24.9%.” (Introduction)"
"”The contemporary status of women in Saudi Arabia is shaped by the historical legacy ofWahhabiyya and its
transformation into a religious nationalist movement under the banner of the Saudi state. This transformation had an
important impact on gender after the movement became not only state religion but also state nationalism. Under the
auspices of the state,Wahhabiyya transformed personal piety into a public project, the objective of which was to create a
moral community under the authority of a political centre. The personal and the public combined to foster the piety of the
state. The state was able to manipulate public Islam, enforced byWahhabi teachings and scholars, to create a legitimacy
and a rationale for the foundation of a pious nation. But historically, the contemporary state oscillated between
demonstrating piety and Islamic authenticity on the one hand and modernity, reform, and progress on the other. With the
changing and evolving political agenda of the state, we find that the religious element, mainly theWahhabi historical
legacy, was co-opted by a state acting in response to evolving political contexts and agendas of changing historical
periods.” (Chapter 1)"
