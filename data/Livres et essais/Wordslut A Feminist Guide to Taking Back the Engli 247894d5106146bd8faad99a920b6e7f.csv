"Quatrième de couverture :"
"“The word ""bitch"" conjures many images for many people but is most often meant to describe an unpleasant woman."
"Even before its usage to mean a female canine, bitch didn’t refer to gender at all—it originated as a gender-neutral word
meaning genitalia.A perfectly innocuous word devolving into a female insult is the case for tons more terms, including
hussy, which simply meant “housewife,” or slut, which meant “untidy” and was also used to describe men. These words
are just a few among history’s many English slurs hurled at women."
"Amanda Montell, feminist linguist and staff features editor at online beauty and health magazine Byrdie.com,deconstructs language—from insults and cursing to grammar and pronunciation patterns—to reveal the ways it has beenused for centuries to keep women form gaining equality. Ever wonder why so many people are annoyed when womenuse the word “like” as a filler? Or why certain gender neutral terms stick and others don’t? Or even how linguists havehistorically discussed women’s speech patterns? Wordslut is no stuffy academic study; Montell’s irresistible humorshines through, making linguistics not only approachable but both downright hilarious and profound.”"
