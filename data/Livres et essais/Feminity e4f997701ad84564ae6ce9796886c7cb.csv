"Extraits et citations :"
"“The tyranny ofVenus is felt whenever a woman thinks—or whenever a man thinks and tells a woman—that her hips are
too wide, her thighs are too large, her breasts are too small, her waist is too high, her legs are too short to meet the
current erotic standard.”"
"“As Beauvoir remarked, “It is not easy to play the idol, the fairy, the faraway princess, when one feels a bloody cloth
between one’s legs; and, more generally, when one is conscious of the primitive misery of being a body.”"
"“Femininity pleases men because it makes them appear more masculine by contrast; and, in truth, conferring an extra
portion of unearned gender distinction on men, an unchallenged space in which to breathe freely and feel stronger, wiser,
more competent, is femininity’s special gift. One could say that masculinity is often an effort to please women, but
masculinity is known to please by displays of mastery and competence while femininity pleases by suggesting that these
concerns, except in small matters, are beyond its intent. Whimsy, unpredictability and patterns of thinking and behavior
that are dominated by emotion, such as tearful expressions of sentiment and fear, are thought to be feminine precisely
because they lie outside the established route to success.”"
"“To fail at the feminine difference is to appear not to care about men, and to risk the loss of their attention and approval."
"To be insufficiently feminine is viewed as a failure in core sexual identity, or as a failure to care sufficiently about
oneself, for a woman found wanting will be appraised (and will appraise herself) as mannish or neutered or simply
unattractive, as men have defined these terms.”"
"Quatrième de couverture :"
"“With intelligence and humor, Susan Brownmiller explores the history and unspoken rules of the burden of ""feminine
perfection"""
"What is femininity? How is it measured? What are its demands? How are women meant to dress, look, think, act, feel,
and be, according to the mores of society?"
"Susan Brownmiller offers a witty and often pointed critique of the concept of femininity in contemporary culture and
throughout history. She explores the demands placed upon women to fit an established mold, examines female
stereotypes, and celebrates the hard-won advances in women's lifestyle and attire."
"At once profound, revolutionary, empowering, and entertaining, ""Femininity ""challenges the accepted female norm while
appreciating the women throughout history who have courageously broken free of its constraints.”"
