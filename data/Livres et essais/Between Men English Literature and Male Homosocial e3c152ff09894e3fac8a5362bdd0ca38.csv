"Quatrième de couverture:"
"""First published in 1985, Between Men was a decisive intervention in gender studies, a book that all but singlehandedlydislodged a tradition of literary critique that suppressed queer subjects and subjectivities. With stunning foresight andconceptual power, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's work opened not only literature but also politics, society, and culture tobroader investigations of power, sex, and desire, and to new possibilities of critical agency."
"Illuminating with uncanny prescience Western society's evolving debates on gender and sexuality, Between Men still hasmuch to teach us. With a new foreword byWayne Koestenbaum emphasizing the work's ongoing relevance, BetweenMen engages with Shakespeare's Sonnets, Wycherley's The Country Wife, Sterne's A Sentimental Journey ThroughFrance and Italy, Hogg's The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner, Tennyson's The Princess, Eliot'sAdam Bede, Thackeray's The History of Henry Esmond, Esq., and Dickens's Our Mutual Friend and The Mystery ofEdwin Drood, among many other texts. Its pathbreaking analysis of homosocial desire in Western literature remains vitalto the future of queer studies and to explorations of the social transformations in which it participates."
