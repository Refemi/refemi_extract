"“Queer theory’s analysis of heteronormativity reflects a political and theoretical move away from treating sexual
identities as “stable, transhistorical, or authentic.” Instead queer theorists explore the production of sexual subjectivities
and the distinction between normative and nonnormative sexualities. Thus, they critically examine how the idealized
heterosexual norm not only produces a homosexual/heterosexual binary but also what Michel Foucault might
characterize as a “distribution” of sexualities around the norm. Gayle Rubin provides one model of distribution through
her image of a pyramid: “Marital reproductive heterosexuals are alone at the top of the erotic pyramid. Clamoring below
are unmarried heterosexuals in couples, followed by most other heterosexuals.…”"
"Quatrième de couverture :"
"“State alert as pregnant asylum seekers aim for Ireland.” “Country Being Held Hostage by Con Men, Spongers, and
Those Taking Advantage of the Maternity Residency Policy.” From 1997 to 2004, headlines such as these dominated
Ireland’s mainstream media as pregnant immigrants were recast as “illegals” entering the country to gain legal residency
through childbirth. As immigration soared, Irish media and politicians began to equate this phenomenon with illegal
immigration that threatened to destroy the country’s social, cultural, and economic fabric."
"Pregnant on Arrival explores how pregnant immigrants were made into paradigmatic figures of illegal immigration, aswell as the measures this characterization set into motion and the consequences for immigrants and citizens. Whilefocusing on Ireland, Eithne Luibhéid’s analysis illuminates global struggles over the citizenship status of children born toimmigrant parents in countries as diverse as the United States, Hong Kong, and elsewhere. Scholarship on the socialconstruction of the illegal immigrant calls on histories of colonialism, global capitalism, racism, and exclusionary nationbuilding but has been largely silent on the role of nationalist sexual regimes in determining legal status. Eithne Luibhéidturns to queer theory to understand how pregnancy, sexuality, and immigrants’ relationships to prevailing sexual normsaffect their chances of being designated as legal or illegal."
"Pregnant on Arrival offers unvarnished insight into how categories of immigrant legal status emerge and change, howsexual regimes figure prominently in these processes, and how efforts to prevent illegal immigration ultimately redefinenationalist sexual norms and associated racial, gender, economic, and geopolitical hierarchies."
