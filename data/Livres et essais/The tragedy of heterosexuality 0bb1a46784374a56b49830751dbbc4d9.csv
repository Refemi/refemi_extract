"""I AM WORRIED ABOUT STRAIGHT PEOPLE. AND I AM NOT the only one. Queer people have been concerned
about straight culture for decades, not only for our own sake—because we fear homophobic violence or erasure of queer
subculture—but also because straight culture’s impact on straight women often elicits our confusion and distress."
"Erotically uninspired or coercive, given shape by the most predictable and punishing gender roles, emotionally scripted
by decades of inane media and self-help projects, and outright illogical as a set of intimate relations anchored in a
complaint-ridden swirl of desire and misogyny, straight culture for many queers is perplexing at best and repulsive at
worst. And yet queer people often leave the issue alone because no matter how worrisome straight culture may appear to
us, we know all too well the problems with denying people their erotic attachments or critiquing an entire population’s
sexual orientation."""
"""This book is about a critical but still largely overlooked consequence of the drowning out of lesbian feminist ideas and
experiences. When lesbian feminist ideas are sidelined, we keep our focus on queer misery, and we fail to name the
contradictions and miseries of straight culture—the entrapment, the disappointment, the antagonism, the boredom, the
unwanted sex, the toxic masculinity, and the countless daily injustices endured by straight women. This book is about the
failure to recognize these not only as feminist problems but more specifically as straight problems that many queer
women are wildly grateful to have escaped. While conservatives have long promoted the belief that queer relationships
are unnatural, damaged, and fraught with various kinds of dysfunction, this project examines what might be gained from
raising similar questions about the health and sustainability of heterosexual culture—a culture arguably damaged by
misogyny, even as it has been unwilling to address the structural causes of this damage."""

"""A troubling account of heterosexual desire in the era of #MeToo"
"Heterosexuality is in crisis. Reports of sexual harassment, misconduct, and rape saturate the news in the era of #MeToo."
"Straight men and women spend thousands of dollars every day on relationship coaches, seduction boot camps, and
couple’s therapy in a search for happiness."
"In The Tragedy of Heterosexuality, Jane Ward smartly explores what, exactly, is wrong with heterosexuality in thetwenty-first century, and what straight people can do to fix it for good. She shows how straight women, and to a lesserextent straight men, have tried to mend a fraught patriarchal system in which intimacy, sexual fulfillment, and mutualrespect are expected to coexist alongside enduring forms of inequality, alienation, and violence in straight relationships."
"Ward also takes an intriguing look at the multi-billion-dollar self-help industry, which markets goods and services to help
heterosexual couples without addressing the root of their problems. Ultimately, she encourages straight men and women
to take a page out of queer culture, reminding them “about the human capacity to desire, fuck, and show respect at the
same time.”"""
