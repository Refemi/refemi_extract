"“This chapter provides a snapshot of the movement and focuses on the development of Chinese feminism. It also focuses
on the relationship between women and a party/state that claims women's liberation as its mandate, and shows how this
specific context poses a challenge to the women's movement of combining a top-down and a bottom-up strategy. The
chapter reviews the complicated legacies of Marxism to and the Chinese communist party' impact on the women's
movement. As a Chinese woman remarked, ""There is something negative within the positive, positive within the
negative."" The chapter addresses issues left from China's traditional and revolutionary past and responding to challenges
emerging in the reform that today's women's movement is shaping a new future for women and for China as well. It
shows Chinese scholars' and activists' efforts in grappling with the changing political and historical themes of Western
women's movements and in creating a concept of Chinese feminism at the same time.” Chapter 1"
"“This chapter examines the evolution of the women's movement in Kenya from precolonial times to the present. It
considers the women's movement to be synonymous with the emergence of women's groups. The chapter provides a
brief overview of Kenyan political and economic history and its impact on women. It also examines these group
activities at three levels: the women's group movement, largely rural and grassroots in nature; formal women's
organizations; and the actions of individual women. The chapter discusses the role played by the dominant patriarchal
structures and existing sociocultural practices in shaping the women's movement. It reviews the role of donor agencies
andWestern development approaches in shaping the movement. The women left to form their own group, the Mumbi
Central Association, named for the mythical mother of the Agikuyu. In the postcolonial context the movement has
become more diversified. Kenyan society is characterized by overarching patriarchal dominance and repressive
sociocultural practices.” Chapter 7"
