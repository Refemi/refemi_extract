"""An exciting new popular study of the male body--fresh, honest, and full of revelations"
"In this surprising, candid cultural analysis, Susan Bordo begins with a frank, tender look at her own father's body and
goes on to perceptively scrutinize the presentation of maleness in everyday life."
"Men's (and women's) ideas about men's bodies are heavily influenced by society's expectations, and Bordo helps us
understand where those ideas come from. In chapters on the penis (in all its incarnations), fifties Hollywood, male beauty
standards, and sexual harassment, and in discussions of topics ranging from Marlon Brando and Boogie Nights to Philip
Roth and Lady Chatterley's Lover, Bordo offers fresh and unexpected insights. Always--whether she is examining
Michael Jordan or Humbert Humbert, the butch phallus or her own grade-school experiences--she rejects rigid categories
in favor of an honest, nuanced version of men as flesh-and-blood human beings."""

"A propos de l'autrice Susan Bordo :"
"She received her Ph.D. from the State University of NewYork in 1982. She currently holds the Otis A. Singletary Chair
in the Humanities at the University of Kentucky where she teaches English andWomen's studies. Bordo specializes in
contemporary culture and its relation to the body, focusing on modern female disorders such as anorexia and bulimia,
cosmetic surgery, beauty and evolutionary theory. She also deals with racism and the body, issues of masculinity along
with issues of sexual harassment."
"Bordo's writing contributes to a body of feminist, cultural and gender studies, linking modern consumer culture directlyto the formation of gendered bodies. She is known for her Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body(1993), a text that looks at the impact of popular culture (television, advertisements, and magazines, for example) inshaping the female body while also looking at typical female disorders such as hysteria, agoraphobia, anorexia nervosaand bulimia as ""complex crystallizations of culture""."
