"""Dans les procès, elles ont représenté 80% des accusés et 85% des condamnés. Elles étaient aussi plus démunies face à la
machine judiciaire : en France, les hommes comptaient pour 20% des accusés mais ils furent à l'origine de 50% des
procédures en appel devant le Parlement. Alors qu'auparavant les tribunaux refusaient leur témoignage, les Européennes
n'accédèrent au statut de sujets à part entière aux yeux de la loi que pour être accusées en masse de sorcellerie."""
""" Historians were denying that misogyny and patriarchy are valid historical categories and were refusing to treat women
as a recognizable historical group. Reading these works is like reading accounts of the Nazi holocaust in which everyone
would agree that the majority of victims were Jewish, but no one would mention anti-Semitism or the history of violent
persecution against Jews, thereby implying that it was ""natural"" for Jews to be victims. Without mention of a tradition of
oppression of women, the implication for the sixteenth century is that of course would be attacked-and that it must
somehow have been their fault. This is what historians conclude when they have no awareness of traditional misogyny or
traditional oppression of women."" page 4"
"""The patriarchal system also explains why many women accused other females: if a woman displeased or threatened the
men of her community, she would also be seen as dangerous by the women who depended on or identified with those
men. The internalization of ""who is not acceptable"" goes even deeper than that.Women-and other oppressed groups-
sometimes try to outdo their oppressors in scorning persons perceived as outsiders, in hope of being accepted, or
tolerated, themselves. In the witchcraft trials, the poor attacked those even poorer; marginalized women attacked those
women even further out of power than they. Women accusers often acted at the behest of their menfolk, as part of a
family strategy of accusation."" page 10"
"""Though economic motives are important in many trials, they seem to have played an inordinate role in New England."
"Carol Karlsen analyzed the social and financial destruction of a well-to-do widow ofWethersfield, Katherine Harrison,
who was singled out by her neighbors as a witch not only because who owned valuable land but also because she did not
remarry; that is, because, in spite of having no sons and, apparently no brothers, she chose to charge of her lands herself."
"Nearby farmers showed her what they thought of this affront to Puritan patriarchy by beating her oxen, boring a hole in
the side of her cow, killing her heifer, breaking the back of her steer, destroying her corn crop, and cutting her hops. The
court apparently refused to protect her, and even gave her a heavy fine. Already suspect as a fortune-teller and healer, she
was driven our ofWethersfield as a witch. The final disposition of her property is not known, but it is clear that Harrison
was not allowed to enjoy it. The point had been made: land was to be inherited and controlled by males."" page 104"
"""In much of western Europe in the peak years of the craze, any woman might have felt like a hunted animal. When we
narrow the focus from the national level to that of village or town, we see the real horror of this period form women. In
an attack that ultimately cut across lines of age, class, and income, women found themselves alone. With few exceptions,
their families did not speak up for them out of fear and, in some cases, turned against them. Accused by their neighbors
or named under duress by their friends, usually they faced the court without any support. Faced with legal procedures
they did not understand and threatened with torture, they struggled to say what they thought the judges wanted to hear."
"But many were not let go, and the hopelessness of the voices that speak through the trial records from prison underlines
the fact that they realized there was no way out for them.Women learned to live with a fear far greater than our current
dread of rape or assault., If a woman could be cried out a witch for telling someone's fortune or speaking back to a
neighbor, well then, one had better stay to oneself, mind one's business- obey one's husband. Women learned especially
not to trust other women, for what woman might not be called up before the judge and start blabbing?"" ""...The chief
sixteenth-century device for teaching both sexes about men's ultimate control over women, however, was the public
execution of witches."""
"""As the sociologist Richard Horsely observed, accusations of witchcraft were ""a highly effective means of social
control."" """
"""These events [intolerance and massacres of women, Jews, Moors, Indians, Africans, and all other conquered peoples]
hold up a mirror to European men of power, and the image reflected is an ugly one, deeply disturbing for the future of
any less powerful group whom they might control. Todoros'v chilling comment is apt: ""The 'barbarity' of the Spaniards
has nothing atavistic or bestial about it; it is quite human and heralds the advent of modern times."" "" page 165"
"""Asserting that no punishment was cruel enough, he [Bodin, died 1596] advocated torture, especially for children and
delicate persons, and advocated encouraging children to give evidence against parents. Believing that death penalty was
warranted even if normal evidence was lacking, he concluded that it was better to kill innocent persons than to allow a
witch to live."" page 175"
"Quatrième de couverture :"
"""In the sixteenth century, a rise in sexual violence in European society was exacerbated by pressure from church and
state to change basic sexual customs...As the centuries since have shown escalating levels both of violence, general and
sexual, and of state control, the witchcraze can be considered a portent, even a model, of some aspects of what modern
Europe would be like."""
"Over three centuries, approximately one hundred thousand persons, most of whom were women, were put to death under
the guise of ""witch hunts"", particularly in Reformation Europe. The shocking annihilation of women from all walks of
life is explored in this brilliant, authoritative feminist history Anne Llwellyn Barstow. Barstow exposes an unrecognized
holocaust -- the ""ethnic cleansing"" of independent women in Reformation Europe -- and examines the residual attitudes
that continue to influence our culture."
"Barstow argues that it is only with eyes sensitive to gender issues that we can discern what really happened in the
persecution and murder of these women. Her sweeping chronicle examines the scapegoating of women from the ills of
society, investigates how their subjugation to sexual violence and death sent a message of control to all women, and
compares this persecution of women with the enslavement and slaughter of African slaves and Native Americans."
"Ultimately Barstow traces the current backlash against women to its gynophobic torture-filled origins. In the process, she
leaves an indelible mark on our growing understanding of the legacy of violence against women around the world."
