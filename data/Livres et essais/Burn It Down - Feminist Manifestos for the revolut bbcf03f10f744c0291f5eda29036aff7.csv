"Quatrième de couverture :"
"A landmark collection spanning two centuries and four waves of feminist activism and writing, Burn It Down! is atestament to what is possible when women are driven to the edge. The manifesto—raging, demanding, quarreling andprovocative—has always been central to feminism, and it’s the angry, brash feminism we need now."
"Collecting over seventy-five manifestos from around the world, Burn It Down! is a rallying cry and a call to action."
"Among this confrontational sisterhood, you’ll find the Dyke Manifesto by the Lesbian Avengers, The Ax Tampax PoemFeministo by the Bloodsisters Project, The Manifesto of Apocalyptic Witchcraft by Peter Grey, Simone de Beauvoir’spro-abortion Manifesto of the 343, Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female by Frances M. Beal, and many more."
"Feminist academic and writer Breanne Fahs argues that we need manifestos in all their urgent rawness, for it is at the
bleeding edge of rage and defiance that new ideas are born."
