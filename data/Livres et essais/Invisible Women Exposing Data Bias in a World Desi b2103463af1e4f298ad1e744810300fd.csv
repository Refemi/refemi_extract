"Extraits et citations :"
"“Brilliance bias is in no small part a result of a data gap: we have written so many female geniuses out of history, they
just don’t come to mind as easily. The result is when ‘brilliance’ is considered a requirement for a job, what is really
meant is ‘a penis’. Several studies have found that the more a field is culturally understood to require ‘brilliance’ or ‘raw
talent’ to succeed – think philosophy, maths, physics, music composition, computer science – the fewer women there will
be studying and working in it. We just don’t see women as naturally brilliant. In fact, we see femininity as being
inversely associated with brilliance: a recent study where participants were shown photos of male and female science
faculty at elite US universities also found that appearance had no impact on how likely it was that a man would be
judged to be a scientist. When it came to women, however, the more stereotypically feminine they looked, the less likely
it was that people would think they were a scientist.”"
"Quatrième de couverture :"
"'Invisible Women takes on the neglected topic of what we don't know - and why. The result is a powerful, important andeye-opening analysis of the gender politics of knowledge and ignorance. With examples from technology to naturaldisasters, this is an original and timely reminder of why we need women in the leadership of the institutions that shapeevery aspect of our lives.' Cordelia Fine"
"You've heard all about the Gender Pay Gap... Welcome to the Gender Data Gap Our world is largely built for and by
men, in a system that can ignore half the population. This book will tell you how and why this matters"
"In her new book, Invisible Women, award-winning campaigner and writer Caroline Criado Perez shows us how, in aworld largely built for and by men, we are systematically ignoring half the population. She exposes the gender data gap –a gap in our knowledge that is at the root of perpetual, systemic discrimination against women, and that has created apervasive but invisible bias with a profound effect on women’s lives."
"Caroline brings together for the first time an impressive range of case studies, stories and new research from across the
world that illustrate the hidden ways in which women are excluded from the very building blocks of the world we live in,
and the impact this has on their health and wellbeing. From government policy and medical research, to technology,
workplaces, urban planning and the media –"

"Analyse :"
"“1.    The invisibility of the female body: When differences between male and female bodies are unaccounted for in thedata, design is unable to accommodate the female body. This, Perez argues, is a routine occurrence, “Whether medical,technological or architectural – has led to a world that is less hospitable and more dangerous for women to navigate. Itleads to us injuring ourselves in jobs and cars that weren’t designed for our bodies. It leads to us dying from drugs thatdon’t work.”"
"2.    Male sexual violence against women: Failure to report and measure incidences of sexual violence and harassment,results in a lack of data upon which to design a world that is safe for women. The impacts of this can be seen across thedesign of transport, education, and workplace policies."
"3.    Valuing unpaid care work: Perez argues that the trend that is having the most significant impact on womenworldwide is the failure to value women’s unpaid work. By failing to value the unpaid work that women do as carers andin the home, the data that underpins the design of the modern workplace is flawed."
"4.    Women are ‘too complicated’ to measure: When touching on the reasons why women are absent from the data,Perez found a common argument was that women are more complex, less homogenous and, as a result, more difficult toaccount for than men.”"
