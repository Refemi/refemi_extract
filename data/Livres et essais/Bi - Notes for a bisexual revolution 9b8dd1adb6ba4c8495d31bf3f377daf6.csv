"Extraits et citations :"
"“I started doing bisexual activism in 2009, after many years of being active with the radical queer, feminist, and
Palestine solidarity movements. Up until then, I had no idea that these two places in my head—bisexuality and activism
—could connect. I (as well as my bisexual friends) were all active in those movements, organizing and participating in
projects that changed events and politics. Throughout this time, we kept talking about"
"our  bisexuality, about erasure and biphobia in our communities, and wondered why no one was doing anything about it."
"I remember waiting for years for something to start, all the while never thinking about bisexual activism as an option.”"

"Quatrième de couverture :"
"""Depicted as duplicitous, traitorous, and promiscuous, bisexuality has long been suspected, marginalized, and rejected by
both straight and gay communities alike."
"Bi takes a long overdue, comprehensive look at bisexual politics—from the issues surrounding biphobia/monosexism,feminism, and transgenderism to the practice of labeling those who identify as bi as either ""too bisexual” (promiscuousand incapable of fidelity) or ""not bisexual enough” (not actively engaging romantically or sexually with people of at leasttwo different genders). In this forward-thinking and eye-opening book, feminist bisexual and genderqueer activist ShiriEisner takes readers on a journey through the many aspects of the meanings and politics of bisexuality, specificallyhighlighting how bisexuality can open up new and exciting ways of challenging social convention."
"Informed by feminist, transgender, and queer theory, as well as politics and activism,"
"Bi is a radical manifesto for a group that has been too frequently silenced, erased, and denied—and a starting point fromwhich to launch a bisexual revolution."""
