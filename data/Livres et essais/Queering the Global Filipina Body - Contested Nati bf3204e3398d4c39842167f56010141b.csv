"Extraits et citations :"
"“Although the representation of the global Filipina body is often overdetermined by the “mutilating productivity” of
global capitalism, it is through “art forms which express the experience of the body” that the Filipina body can be
reimagined, “not as vehicles of labor power and resignation, but as vehicles of liberation.”"
"“One of the first appearances of the figure of the Filipina mail-order bride within LGBT popular culture in the GlobalNorth occurred in the 1994 Australian film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, directed by Stephan Elliott."
"In the now infamous ping-pong-ball scene, three Australian drag queens, Bernice, Felicia, and Mitzi, take the stage at a
local pub in the Australian outback to the confusion and disgust of the mainly heterosexual male clientele. Interrupting
the drag queens’ performance, the Filipina bride character, Cynthia, bursts onto the stage, to the delight of the straight
male customers.”"
"“National Heroes, a dramatic vignette presented at the 2006 Pilipino Cultural Night (PCN) ReCreation, at the Universityof California at Berkeley, begins with a completely silent, dark stage. Alongside hundreds of Filipina/o Americanstudents and their families, I wait in the dark for the scene to unfold onstage.”"
"Quatrième de couverture :"
"""Contemporary popular culture stereotypes Filipina women as sex workers, domestic laborers, mail order brides, and
caregivers. These figures embody the gendered and sexual politics of representing the Philippine nation in the Filipina/o
diaspora. Gina K.Velasco explores the tensions within Filipina/o American cultural production between feminist and
queer critiques of the nation and popular nationalism as a form of resistance to neoimperialism and globalization."
"Using a queer diasporic analysis,Velasco examines the politics of nationalism within Filipina/o American cultural
production to consider an essential question: can a queer and feminist imagining of the diaspora reconcile with gendered
tropes of the Philippine nation? Integrating a transnational feminist analysis of globalized gendered labor with a
consideration of queer cultural politics,Velasco envisions forms of feminist and queer diasporic belonging, while
simultaneously foregrounding nationalist movements as vital instruments of struggle."
