"Extraits et citations :"
"“A first thing to note, in case it’s unclear, is that I am not arguing against legal protections for trans people against
violence, discrimination or coercive surgeries. I enthusiastically support these protections.”"
"“Butler makes the general assumption that anything at all humans can meaningfully think about is socially constructed,
‘all the way down’ as it were. This means she thinks there are no material facts before language – that is, prior to
culturally specific linguistic and social constructions of them. Linguistic categories, including scientific and biological
ones, aren’t a means of reflecting existing divisions in the world, but a means of creating things that otherwise wouldn’t
have existed.”"
"“Trans people are trans people. We should get over it. They deserve to be safe, to be visible throughout society without
shame or stigma, and to have exactly the life opportunities non-trans people do. Their transness makes no difference to
any of this. What trans people don’t deserve, however, is to be publicly misrepresented in philosophical terms that make
no sense; nor to have their everyday struggles instrumentalised in the name of political initiatives most didn’t ask for, and
which alienate other groups by rigidly encroaching on their hard-won rights. Nor do trans people deserve to be terrified
by activist propaganda into thinking themselves more vulnerable to violence than they actually are.”"
"“LGBT activism also fails on intersectionality for trans people themselves. It has no interest in acknowledging the
somewhat different political and social situations of trans men and trans women respectively, but insists on treating both
as identical for the purposes of lobbying. As far as trans activism is apparently concerned, there is no relevant difference
in the situations of a fourteen-year-old transidentifying teenage female, attracted to other females, who is crowdfunding
‘top surgery’ and self-harming in the meantime, and a forty-one-year-old late-transitioning autogynephilic heterosexual
male with no intention of divorcing the wife.”"
"“I am critical of gender identity theory – but not of trans people, for whom I have friendly sympathy and respect.”"
"Quatrième de couverture :"
"Material Girls presents a timely and opinionated critique of the culturally influential theory that we each have an innerfeeling about our sex called a gender identity, and that this feeling is more socially significant than our actual biologicalsex. It makes a clear and humane feminist case for retaining the ability to discuss material reality about biological sex ina range of important contexts, including female-only spaces and resources, healthcare, epidemiology, politicalorganization and data collection. It investigates the intellectual history of gender identity, showing how the concept islinked to a misguided philosophical picture which broadly rejects science and conflates facts about intersex people withfacts about trans people. Material Girls concludes with a positive vision for the future, of collaboration betweenfeminists and trans activists, detailing how they could work together to achieve some of their political aims."
