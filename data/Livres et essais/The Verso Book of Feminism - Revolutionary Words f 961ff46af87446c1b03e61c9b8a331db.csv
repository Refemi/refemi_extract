"Throughout written history and across the world, women have protested the restrictions of gender and the limitationsplaced on womens bodies and womens lives. Peopleof any and no genderhave protested and theorized, pennedmanifestos and written poetry and songs, testified and lobbied, gone on strike and fomented revolution, quietlydemanded that there is an I and loudly proclaimed that there is a we. The Book of Feminism chronicles this history ofdefiance and tracks it around the world as it develops into a multivocal and unabashed force. Global in scope, The Bookof Feminism shows the breadth of feminist protest and of feminist thinking, moving through the female poets of ChinasTang Dynasty to accounts of indigenous women in the Caribbean resisting Columbuss expedition, British suffragistsmilitating for the vote to the revolutionary petroleuses of the 1848 Paris Commune, the first century Trung sisters whofought for the independence of Nam Viet to women in 1980s Botswana fighting for equal protection under the law, fromthe erotica of the 6th century and the 19th century to radical queer politics in the 20th and 21st. The Book of Feminism isa weapon, a force, a lyrical cry, and an ongoing threat to misogyny everywhere."
