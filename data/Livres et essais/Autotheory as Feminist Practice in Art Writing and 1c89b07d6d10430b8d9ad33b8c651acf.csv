"“Autotheory—the commingling of theory and philosophy with autobiography—as a mode of critical artistic practice
indebted to feminist writing and activism."
"In the 2010s, the term “autotheory” began to trend in literary spheres, where it was used to describe books in which
memoir and autobiography fused with theory and philosophy. In this book, Lauren Fournier extends the meaning of the
term, applying it to other disciplines and practices. Fournier provides a long-awaited account of autotheory, situating it as
a mode of contemporary, post-1960s artistic practice that is indebted to feminist writing, art, and activism. Investigating
a series of works by writers and artists including Chris Kraus and Adrian Piper, she considers the politics, aesthetics, and
ethics of autotheory."
"Fournier argues that the autotheoretical turn signals the tenuousness of illusory separations between art and life, theoryand practice, work and the self—divisions long blurred by feminist artists and scholars. Autotheory challenges dominantapproaches to philosophizing and theorizing while enabling new ways for artists and writers to reflect on their lives. Sheargues that Kraus's 1997 I Love Dick marked the emergence of a newly performative, post-memoir “I”; recasts Piper's1971 performance work Food for the Spirit as autotheory; considers autotheory as critique; examines practices of citationin autotheoretical work, including Maggie Nelson's The Argonauts; and looks at the aesthetics and ethics of disclosureand exposure, exploring the nuanced feminist politics around autotheoretical practices and such movements as #MeToo."
"Fournier formulates autotheory as a reflexive movement, connecting thinking, making art, living, and theorizing.”"

"“Lauren Fournier’s new book Autotheory as Feminist Practice in Art, Writing, and Criticism is the first monograph onautotheory: an emergent term that is beginning to trend in arts and humanities scholarship. Popularized by thepublication of Maggie Nelson’s memoir The Argonauts (2015), “autotheory” is being used to describe hybrid literary andartistic works that use lived experience and first-person narratives to engage with theory and philosophy. Fournier isparticularly interested in post-1960s autotheory and the possibilities it offers for decolonial and intersectional feminism."
"Fournier resists providing a generic definition of autotheory; instead she considers autotheory as an impulse or practice
rather than a fixed mode and is more interested in the ideas, questions, and contradictions that autotheory raises than in
its parameters. The book is thematically structured and packed with case studies of visual artworks, performances for
video, and written texts. The depth and specificity of the case studies do, however, construct a delineation of autotheory
that will be useful to new and seasoned readers of autotheory. A connective methodology allows Fournier to touch on
countless threads, which future scholarship might pick up, while always returning to her key concerns: accessibility and"
"intersectional feminism. There are a couple of autotheoretical moments in the book, in which Fournier recalls her own
experience of academic events to consider how autotheory might contribute to institutional change. Throughout the
book, Fournier situates her claims in cultural contexts such as the #MeToo movement and fourth wave feminism, as well
as considering the real-life consequences of call out and cancel cultures in the final chapter on disclosure and exposure: a
topic that is often discussed in autobiography studies but here remains fresh and relevant.”"
