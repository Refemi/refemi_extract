"Quatrième de couverture :"
"“Alternative lifestyles are anathema to the inhabitants of rural areas of the Bible Belt. Even gays and lesbians themselves
resist the notions of community and self-identification espoused by city queers. As Wilson demonstrates, it is the
combination of internalized self-hatred, the influence of the right-wing Republicans and religious fervor, together with
the hatred, fear, and suspicion aroused by the intervention of gay and lesbian activists from urban areas, that determine
the tenor of gay life in the American rural South.A series of shocking interviews with local religious leaders and medical
experts whose opinions shape local discourse in sexuality, abortion, feminism, and AIDS are the foundation for this
revelatory study.”"
