"Quatrième de couverture :"
"In Living a Feminist Life Sara Ahmed shows how feminist theory is generated from everyday life and the ordinaryexperiences of being a feminist at home and at work. Building on legacies of feminist of color scholarship in particular,Ahmed offers a poetic and personal meditation on how feminists become estranged from worlds they critique—often bynaming and calling attention to problems—and how feminists learn about worlds from their efforts to transform them."
"Ahmed also provides her most sustained commentary on the figure of the feminist killjoy introduced in her earlier work
while showing how feminists create inventive solutions—such as forming support systems—to survive the shattering
experiences of facing the walls of racism and sexism. The killjoy survival kit and killjoy manifesto, with which the book
concludes, supply practical tools for how to live a feminist life, thereby strengthening the ties between the inventive
creation of feminist theory and living a life that sustains it."

"A propos de l’autrice Sara Ahmed :"
"Sara Ahmed is a feminist writer, scholar, and activist. She is the author of Willful Subjects, On Being Included, ThePromise of Happiness, and Queer Phenomenology, all also published by Duke University Press."
"“A feminist and queer of colour, Sarah Ahmed lectured in Women's Studies at Lancaster University and was later
appointed by Goldsmiths College, University of London. During 2016, however, Ahmed would resign from her post at
Goldsmiths—in protest against institutional discrimination against sexual harassment. Coming from an interdisciplinary
background, Ahmed has studied philosophy, women's studies, and cultural studies. Within all of these fields, she finds
women of colour's writing most empowering and sees it as her genealogy.”"
