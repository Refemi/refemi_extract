"This study examines the process of identity formation in terms of discontinuities, continuities, resistance, and
reconstruction in the lives of women refugees from Ethiopia. The research methodology is qualitative and interpretive."
"Significant life experiences prior to the terror that led to their flight, their own definitions of the causes and events that
prompted them to flee their homes and country, their flight experiences, the problems and opportunities encountered on
resettlement in Canada are woven together to provide a holistic picture of the social construction of identities of women
refugees in this study. The analysis of these experiences also reveals how women, in their search to belong, struggled to
make meaning of their experiences and to reconstruct their identities. An underlying assumption of the interpretation of
the experiences of women refugees is that earlier life experiences and identities are not shed when people become
refugees. Furthermore, being ""refugee"" is not the totality of their identity and social construction. Much of the literature
on women refugees depicts them as victims and vulnerable because they are women. While there is a truth to this
depiction, focusing on their vulnerability places the problem on women rather than on the aggression and discrimination
perpetrated against them because they are women. As I listened to and reflected on the life journeys of women in this
study, I was deeply moved by their strength and courage. The determination not only to survive but also to maintain their
identities and integrity, and struggle to fulfill their personal and family goals often awed me. Their actions were clearly
aimed at changing their circumstances. I came to recognize these action as forms of resistance. This understanding of
resistance has made me see the women in my study as victimized rather than as victims: in an ongoing struggle against
victimizing forces they have encountered they are active shapers of their personal and collective lives. Indeed, these
women in their decisions to flee their homes and country and in their daily lives thereafter were challenging state
violence and patriarchal tradition."
