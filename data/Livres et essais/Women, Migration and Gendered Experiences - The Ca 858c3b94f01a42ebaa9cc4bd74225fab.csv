"“The feminist and the constructivist approaches provide the epistemological lenses of this research. The feminist
standpoint adopted here aims to critically analyse women’s experiences and voices, while taking into account the
differences between them. This book focuses on Albanian migrant women’s experiences and starts with the assumption
that gender is a social construct and an organising principle of society. Within the framework of these two
epistemological lenses, I seek to understand how gender relates to the migration process. In particular, I will look into
how gender shapes migration and the construction of the migrant woman, on the one hand, and how different migration
processes infuence gender relations, on the other. Until the mid-1980s, women were mostly invisible in migration
studies, except as the family members in charge of the domestic sphere and childrearing. When their experiences were
addressed, studies treated women as the dependents of men, who were considered to be the leading providers of
household resources. These views started to change once scholars such as Morokvasic (1984b) introduced a gender
perspective into migration studies, and thus began to examine women’s particular experiences at large. Studies have
shown that gender informs migration processes by infuencing migrants’ projects, trajectories, work opportunities, family
relations and social networks (Boyd & Grieco, 2003; Dahinden et al., 2007). Scholars have demonstrated that many
women migrate on their own to help their families economically, in contrast to the image of women as passive dependent
subjects that is often presented in the literature on migration (Kofman & Raghuram, 2015; Oso Casas, 2006; Schmoll,
2006; Vianello, 2009).Women participate in the decision-making process regarding migration, receive and send
remittances and support the migration of other family members and themselves (Dahinden et al., 2007). Additionally,
analyses of migration have also considered the intersection of gender with class and race (Dahinden 2010b; Silvey 2004;
Parreñas, 2001). Studies have also shown that it is challenging to draw universal conclusions regarding the interrelation
of gender and migration. According to Dahinden et al. (2007), migration infuences gender relations in various ways; it
may reinforce gender inequalities or question and transform them. Migration can be either exploitative or liberating: it
might lead to new opportunities and better economic situations but also new gender constraints and precarity
(Morokvasic, 2003; Moujoud, 2008)."
