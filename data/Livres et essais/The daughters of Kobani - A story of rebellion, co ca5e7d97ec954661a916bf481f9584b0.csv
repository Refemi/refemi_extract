"For Azeema, as for many other members of the Syrian Kurdish Peoples Protection Units, the path to the Kobani
battlefield in 2014 had started during street protests in her hometown of Qamishli ten years earlier."
"The Kurds made up Syria's largest ethnic minority at roughly 10 percent of a country of around twenty-one million. The
Kurds were a people split across four countries, the largest ethnic group with no state of its own. This hadn't been the
plan: The 1920 Treaty of S
vres had promised the creation of a Kurdish state, but Turkey's first president, Mustafa"
"Kemal AtatŸrk, rejected the treaty immediately upon taking office in 1923. The Treaty of S vres soon gave way to the
Treaty of Lausanne, negotiated with AtatŸrk's new government, which did not reference a Kurdish homeland at all."
"Lacking their own state, thirty million Kurds found themselves spread across what became, in the post-Ottoman era,
modern-day Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran. Turkey was home to the largest Kurdish population."
"None of these four countries embraced Kurdish identity or the Kurds' push for their own land. With the rise of Arab
nationalist governments in Syria, the rights Kurds did enjoy began to narrow: Kurdish-language media outlets shuttered
and teaching in Kurdish became illegal. By the end of the 1950s, Kurds could not apply for positions in either the police
or the military."
"The Syrian Kurds in many ways lived as outsiders within their nation, a regime officially known as the Syrian Arab
Republic. The national government denied citizenship to tens of thousands of Syrian Kurds who missed the surprise one-
day census in 1962 in the Kurdish-dominated province of Hassakeh. As a result, Kurds were unable to attain marriage
and birth certificates, university slots, and passports; officially, they were stateless. The repression grew in 1963 when a
coup brought the Baath Party to rule in Damascus. A decade later, the Syrian regime's ""Arab cordon"" policy took Kurdish
lands along the borders with Iraq and Turkey. As part of the policy, the government brought Arab families to live on
these lands owned by Kurds and now confiscated by Damascus. Syrian regime teachers taught in Arabic in Kurdish-area
schools-no Kurdish permitted. Kurds had no legal right to speak Kurdish and publishers no legal right to print Kurdish
text. Kurds had only a minimal right to own property, no right to celebrate traditional Kurdish holidays, which remained
illegal by law, and no ability to name their children in their own language or to play their own music. Anyone-Kurd or
Arab-who opposed the regime faced jail or worse, and the Syrian government's security apparatus monitored the area
closely. Stepping out of line or moving against these rules meant defying a watchful regime that regularly jailed,
tortured, and disappeared its enemies."
"For decades, young Kurds had gone along with their elders as they sought to live their lives within the regime's
boundaries. The regime officially outlawed political parties other than its own, but Kurds still organized loosely in an
alphabet soup of political organs.Yet by 2004, the winds were shifting, in no small part because Kurds across the border
in Iraq had won more rights as a result of the U.S. ousting Saddam Hussein.A no-fly zone in place for decades had
offered a de facto safe neighborhood for Iraqi Kurds. The 2003 ousting of the Iraqi leader who had murdered and gassed
his Kurdish population had opened the way for greater recognition of Kurds' rights in the Iraqi constitution-and had been
greeted enthusiastically by young Syrian Kurds. News that U.S. president George W. Bush might soon turn to
sanctioning the Syrian regime was not lost on this group.”"
"Quatrième de couverture :"
"“In 2014, northeastern Syria might have been the last place you would expect to find a revolution centered on women's
rights. But that year, an all-female militia faced off against ISIS in a little town few had ever heard of: Kobani. By then,
the Islamic State had swept across vast swaths of the country, taking town after town and spreading terror as the civil war
burned all around it. From that unlikely showdown in Kobani emerged a fighting force that would wage war against ISIS
across northern Syria alongside the United States. In the process, these women would spread their own political vision,
determined to make women's equality a reality by fighting—house by house, street by street, city by city—the men who
bought and sold women."
"Based on years of on-the-ground reporting,The Daughters of Kobani is the unforgettable story of the women of theKurdish militia that improbably became part of the world's best hope for stopping ISIS in Syria. Drawing from hundreds"
"of hours of interviews, bestselling author Gayle Tzemach Lemmon introduces us to the women fighting on the frontlines, determined to not only extinguish the terror of ISIS but also prove that women could lead in war and must enjoyequal rights come the peace. In helping to cement the territorial defeat of ISIS, whose savagery toward women astoundedthe world, these women played a central role in neutralizing the threat the group posed worldwide. In the process theyearned the respect—and significant military support—of U.S. Special Operations Forces. Rigorously reported andpowerfully told, The Daughters of Kobani shines a light on a group of women intent on not only defeating the IslamicState on the battlefield but also changing women's lives in their corner of the Middle East and beyond."
