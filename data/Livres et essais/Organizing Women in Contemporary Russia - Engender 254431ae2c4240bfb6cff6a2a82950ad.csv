"“Around noon on a chilly day in early March – International Women's Day, 1996 – a group of women gathers in
Moscow's Pushkin Square. They are there for a demonstration:Women in Black AgainstViolence. The women mill
around, waiting for the protest march to begin; they plan to walk to the Nikitskie Gates, a few blocks away. More women
trickle into the square in twos and threes. Soon, the group has expanded to about sixty. A few stand silently, dressed in
black, holding a banner reading “Women in Black Against Violence.” Two young women hold a large blue banner with
white felt letters, spelling out a slogan strange and unfamiliar to Russian passersby: “There are no free men without free
women. Amazons:Women Smashing Stereotypes!” The “O” letters are drawn as woman-symbols, a little cross beneath
each one. Representatives of the “Sisters” Rape Crisis Center circulate, handing out business cards and leaflets
advertising their services for victims of rape. One woman holds a poster decrying Soviet agitprop about International
Women's Day. It is a three-frame cartoon. In the first frame, dated “March 7th,” a man is shown threatening a woman
with his first. The second frame, “March 8th,” shows him presenting her with a bouquet of flowers. The third frame,
“March 9th,” simply repeats the image from the first frame. In a similar vein, a middle-aged woman carries a poster
reading, “We demand the adoption of a law against domestic violence.” (Introduction)"
"“In 1985, when Mikhail Gorbachev was selected by his colleagues on the Politburo to become general secretary of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union, there was only one women's organization in Soviet Russia: the Soviet Women's
Committee. It was a state-controlled organization, operating under the watchful eye of Communist Party apparatchiks. A
decade later, there were hundreds of women's groups, clubs, initiatives, and projects officially registered and operating in
Russia. Estimates put the number of unregistered groups at several thousand. Relative to the previous decades of Soviet
rule, this increase represented a tremendous surge in civic action, spurred by the political and economic transitions that
began in the late 1980s under Gorbachev and continued underYeltsin's administration.” (Chapter 1)"
"“Scholars of contentious politics have argued that social movements are likely to fare best where “parliamentary politics,
democratic institutions, and durable political competition” have already taken root. In places where those conditions do
not hold, such as the post-Soviet states, we can fully expect social movements to look and behave differently from their
Western counterparts. But whatever their appearance and characteristics, all social movements – in any country – are
engaged in attempts to serve essentially the same purpose: to work toward social change that will rectify a situation
perceived as unjust. In other words, social movements strive to alter the status quo of the power distribution in society –
whether at the level of material resources or the more intangible level of status and “identity.” Most often, social
movements, including the women's movement in Russia, entail struggle over a combination of these material and
intangible interests.” (Chapter 2)"
"Quatrième de couverture :"
"This book offers the first comprehensive analysis of the contemporary Russian women's movement and of the social,
political, economic, historical, and international contexts that surround it.Valerie Sperling paints a vivid portrait of the
women's movement's formation and development, paying particular attention to the key challenges facing a social
movement in post-communist society, including the virtual absence of civil society, constant flux in political institutions,
wrenching economic changes, and the movement's own status in a changing transnational environment. The author also
addresses the specific challenges facing women's organizations by discussing societal attitudes towards feminism in
Russia. Based on participant observation, primary source materials, and dozens of interviews conducted in Moscow (as
well as two smaller Russian cities), the narrative brings alive the activists' struggle to build a social movement under
difficult conditions, and sheds new light on the troubled and complex process of Russia's democratization."
