"“It is difficult to begin writing a book with a sense of anticipation that one's reader may already be feeling a sense of
dread. I imagine you scowling, ‘not another book on feminism and postmodernism’. And I imagine you yawning, ‘hasn't
enough been said?’ Of course, the fantasies one has of ‘the reader’ or ‘one's reader’ are always impossible, always
inadequate to their object. But, as someone interested in how feminism and postmodernism can and do speak to each
other, I have a sense in which there is a critical reluctance to pursue a debate on or through these terms at all. So, one
reader of my work comments, ‘my heart did rather sink at the prospect of yet another book on feminism and
postmodernism’. This prospect of readers with sinking hearts is, to say the least, alarming. To deal with this doubling of
affect (the reader's sinking heart, the writer's alarm) I want to ask: is the difficulty simply the proliferation of books on
feminism and postmodernism, or is the difficulty about how the proliferation has taken place and to what effect?"
"Indeed, at the first academic conference at which I presented my work in 1993 the conference organiser commented on
how none of the papers on postmodernism had said anything new or different. She suggested to me that all the papers –
which had offered very different positions and were shaped by diverse disciplinary frameworks – were simply re-staging
an old debate.”"
"“In what space does feminism belong? It is this kind of question concerning belonging – concerning the proper space of
feminism – that has led to a representation of feminism as straddled between the contradictory demands of practice and
theory. On the one hand, feminism has been identified as inherently modern – as a politics committed to emancipation,
agency and rights. But on the other hand, feminism has been seen to be pulled towards the postmodern, to the very
critique of the onto-theological nature of such beliefs. Here feminism, as a set of theoretical perspectives, has
increasingly been identified as postmodern or, as discussed in the introduction, as derivative of postmodernism. This
division between modern and postmodern elements in feminism is hence mapped on to a division between practice and
theory. Regina Gagnier, for example, argues that feminism cannot undermine its basis in a realist epistemology nor its
normative ground in humanism, given that it presupposes that the oppression of women exists and that its project is to
make the world better for women (Gagnier 1990: 24). But, at the same time, she argues that feminism is pushed towards
a postmodern ethics and politics via its very emphasis on the culturally overdetermined constitution of the gendered
subject (Gagnier 1990: 24).”"
"Quatrième de couverture :"
"“Differences That Matter challenges existing ways of theorising the relationship between feminism and postmodernism
which ask 'is or should feminism be modern or postmodern?' Sara Ahmed suggests that postmodernism has been allowed
to dictate feminist debates and calls instead for feminist theorists to speak (back) to postmodernism, rather than simply
speak on (their relationship to) it. Such a 'speaking back' involves a refusal to position postmodernism as a generalisable
condition of the world and requires closer readings of what postmodernism is actually 'doing' in a variety of disciplinary
contexts. Sara Ahmed hence examines constructions of postmodernism in relation to rights, ethics, subjectivity,
authorship, meta-fiction and film.”"
