"“Come out, stand up and let that world know. That would do more to end prejudice overnight than anybody would
imagine. I urge them to do that, urge them to come out. Only that way will we start to achieve our rights. – Harvey Milk,
1977”"
"“In this chapter I develop a theoretical framework around norm visibility that specifi es the conditions under which states
comply with, and societies begin to internalize, norms of tolerance toward sexual minorities. Norm visibility engenders
this broader diffusion of images and ideas that empower the political margins. It moves the margin – in this case LGBT
people – to the center of political debate and public recognition, making it possible for them to claim the rights that are
their due. Coming out is thus a social and political process – one that brings states, publics, and marginalized groups
together – for making the invisible visible and cashing in on the human rights and dignity movements that have marked
European and world politics after WWII.” “The idea that “the personal is political” – that is, social and systemic instead
of isolated and individual (Crenshaw 1991 ) – mobilized the second and third wave of feminists once they came to see
themselves as part of a collective and discover who “they” were (Whittier 2010 ). Similarly, many LGBT people
experienced a fusion of the personal and the political as relatable sexualities became visible. The pioneering homosexual
activist Karl Heinrich Ulrichs described a related experience of discovery when he left Göttingen – where “as far as he
could see, there was no one else like him” – for Berlin in the 1840s (Beachy 2014 , 9). It was there that he would meet
other men with same-sex desires, whom he would describe (using the term urning) in writings that inspired the world’s fi
rst homosexual rights movement just one generation later.”"
"“The speed and direction of diffusion of LGBT norms are also shaped by the degree to which domestic actors are
embedded in transnational advocacy networks. These domestic LGBT advocates – or norm brokers – who tie new-
adopter states to advocacy groups in fi rst-mover states are of central importance due to variability in domestic societal
interpretations of new LGBT norms. Norm brokers make the norm salient by connecting activists to one another and by
grafting international ideas to domestic ones, framing the message to fi t locally.Not only do they redistribute resources
and know-how across borders, they also unite with external elites that have the power to sanction states for
noncompliance.”"

"Quatrième de couverture :"
"“In the last two decades, the LGBT movement has gained momentum that is arguably unprecedented in speed and
suddenness when compared to other human rights movements. This book investigates the recent history of this
transnational movement in Europe, focusing on the diffusion of the norms it champions and the overarching question of
why, despite similar international pressures, the trajectories of socio-legal recognition for LGBT minorities are so
different across states. The book makes the case that a politics of visibility has engendered the interactions between
movements and states that empower marginalized people - mobilizing actors to demand change, influencing the spread
of new legal standards, and weaving new ideas into the fabrics of societies. It documents how this process of 'coming
out' empowers marginalized social groups by moving them to the center of political debate and public recognition and
making it possible for them to obtain rights to which they have due claim.”"
