"Quatrième de couverture :"
"A lucid straightforward illumination of whiteness and white privilege, as it is currently acted-out in school and society,
despite social justice policies. It puts before readers the pervasiveness and meanness of white privilege in
education/schooling and society in this neoliberal, non-post-racial era. Timely and deserving of urgent attention. --Carl
A. Grant, Hoefs Bascom Professor University Wisconsin-Madison and author of Du Bois and Education"
"In this wide-ranging book Bhopal addresses racial inequality in Britain and the United States. She demonstrates how
racial inequality is pervasive in British society across sectors, especially education and the labor market, an important
perspective for scholars. A great introduction to issues of racial inequality. --Natasha Kumar Warikoo, Harvard
University, Graduate School of Education."
"Offers a crucial and timely focus on the perpetuation of white privilege in a society that claims to be post-racial, and the
continuing disadvantages experienced by black and minority ethnic groups... provides a wealth of data on social,
educational and economic inequalities in both the UK and USA where white supremacist hate is increasing. It should be
read by policy makers, practitioners and the public to help them realise how white privilege works and disadvantage is
perpetuated. --Sally Tomlinson, University of Oxford"
