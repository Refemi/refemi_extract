"Susan Brownmiller is an American feminist journalist, author, and activist."
"Brownmiller also participated in civil rights activism, joining CORE and SNCC during the sit-in movement and
volunteering for Freedom Summer in 1964, wherein she worked on voter registration in Meridian, Mississippi. Returning
to New York, she began writing for The VillageVoice and became a network TV newswriter at the American
Broadcasting Company, a job she held until 1968. She first became involved in the Women's Liberation Movement in
NewYork City in 1968, by joining a consciousness-raising group in the newly formed NewYork RadicalWomen
organization. Brownmiller went on to coordinate a sit-in against Ladies' Home Journal in 1970, began work on Against
Our Will after a NewYork Radical Feminists speak-out on rape in 1971, and co-foundedWomen Against Pornography in
1979. She continues to write and speak on feminist issues, including a recent memoir and history of SecondWave radical
feminism. In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution (1999)."
"Brownmiller won an Alicia Patterson Journalism Fellowship in 1973 to research and write about the crime of rape."
