"Extraits et citations :"
"“Each chapter debunks a particular myth in the contemporary gender debate, going against mych of what we are
currenlty being fed from academic experts, educators, scientific publications, and the media; for example, I challenge the
erroneous belief that sex and gender are socially constructed; that there is an infinite number of genders; that young
children with gender dysphoria should be allowed to transition to the opposite sex; and that trans women are
quintessentially no different from women who were birn women. Other taboo truths include how transitioning is
influenced by sexual orientation, and, for some people, sexual arousal; how biological sex differences lead to differences
in dating and sex; and that biology has a greater influence on gender that child-rearing. I also discuss why academic
freedom is so important, particularly within sexology and the biological sciences, at a time when academics are being
treated as pariahs for simply doing their jobs.” (p.10)"
