"“In this now-classic study, Linda Williams moves beyond the impasse of the anti-porn/anti-censorship debate to analyze
what hard-core film pornography is and does—as a genre with a history, as a specific cinematic form, and as part of
contemporary discourse on sexuality. For the 1999 edition, Williams has written a new preface and a new epilogue,
""On/scenities,"" illustrated with 25 photographs. She has also added a supplementary bibliography.”"
"In this unprecedented and brilliant study, Linda Williams moves beyond the impasse of antiporn/anticensorship
positiontaking to analyze what hardcore film pornography is and does—as a genre with a history, as a specific cinematic
form, and as part of contemporary discourse on sexuality. Working against tendencies to oversimplify hard core—either
as pure abusive power or pure liberatory pleasure—Williams sees the form as inherently contradictory. Hard core claims
to speak confessional and involuntary truths of sex. However, analysis of its forms including its spectacular money shots
and sexual numbers parallel to those in musicals reveals that sex in the sense of a natural, visible doing what comes
naturally is in fact the supreme and deeply contradictory fiction of the genre. Gender, the social construction of the
relation between the sexes, is what determines this fiction. For most of its history, pornography has been for men and
about women.Yet in hard core's attempt to solve the riddles of sex with more, different, or better sex, the monolith of
masculine pleasure breaks down and the possibility of women using pornography for their own purposes begins to
emerge. To this end, Williams traces the roots of contemporary hard core's quest to see the truth of sex back to the origins
of cinema itself—in motion studies of women's bodily movements. She then follows the generic development of hard
core through its silent, primitive stag form and into featurelength narratives like Deep Throat and Behind the Green
Door, up to its recent sadomasochistic and couples market permutations—showing how the form has begun to respond
and react to changing gender relations. Neither a defense of what pornography has been nor a utopian dream of what it
should be, this daring book refuses simply to scapegoat the form as the cause of all our ills. Instead, Williams utilizes the
insights of recent studies of mass culture to show that hard core is a discourse, a genre, and a rhetoric that can only be
understood through comparison with, rather than separation from, other forms."
