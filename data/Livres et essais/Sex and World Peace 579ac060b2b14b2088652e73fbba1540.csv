"“Sex and World Peace unsettles a variety of assumptions in political and security discourse, demonstrating that thesecurity of women is a vital factor in the security of the state and its incidence of conflict and war."
"The authors compare micro-level gender violence and macro-level state peacefulness in global settings, supporting their
findings with detailed analyses and color maps. Harnessing an immense amount of data, they call attention to
discrepancies between national laws protecting women and the enforcement of those laws, and they note the adverse
effects on state security of abnormal sex ratios favoring males, the practice of polygamy, and inequitable realities in
family law, among other gendered aggressions."
"The authors find that the treatment of women informs human interaction at all levels of society. Their research challenges
conventional definitions of security and democracy and shows that the treatment of gender, played out on the world
stage, informs the true clash of civilizations. In terms of resolving these injustices, the authors examine top-down and
bottom-up approaches to healing wounds of violence against women, as well as ways to rectify inequalities in family law
and the lack of parity in decision-making councils. Emphasizing the importance of an R2PW, or state responsibility to
protect women, they mount a solid campaign against women's systemic insecurity, which effectively unravels the
security of all.”"
