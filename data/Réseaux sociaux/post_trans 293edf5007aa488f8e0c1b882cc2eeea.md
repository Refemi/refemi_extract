A propos :

Post Trans is a collection of detrans stories from female detransitioners and desisters.

“H***ello, we are Elie and Nele,***

two female detransitioners from Belgium and Germany. Post Trans is a project we have decided to create as we realised that there was a big gap on the topic of detransition.

We believe that it is increasingly important to address this issue and to give support to female individuals who stopped identifying as trans.

Our goal is to provide a space for female detransitioners to share their experiences as well as giving an alternative narrative to the common discussions on transidentity.” @postrans
