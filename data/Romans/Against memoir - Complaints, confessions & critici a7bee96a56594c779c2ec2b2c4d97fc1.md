Quatrième de couverture :

_'"I must find my own complicated junkie to have violent sex with. In 1994, nothing seemed like a better idea, save being able to write about it later.'_

Michelle Tea is our exuberant, witty guide to the hard times and wild creativity of queer life in America. Along the way she reclaims *SCUM Manifesto* author Valerie Solanas as an absurdist, remembers the lives and deaths of the lesbian motorbike gang HAGS and listens to activists at a trans protest camp. This kaleidoscope of love and adventure also makes room for a defence of pigeons and a tale of teenage goths hustling for tips at an ice creamery in a grimy, busted city called Chelsea . Unsparing but unwaveringly kind, Michelle Tea reveals herself and others in unexpected and heartbreaking ways.

*Against Memoir* is the winner of the 2019 PEN Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay. Best known as writer of fiction and memoir, this is the first time Tea s journalism has been collected. Delivered with her signature candour and dark humour, *Against Memoir* solidifies her place as one of the leading queer writers of our time."
