Extraits et citations :

“Six weeks before sex reassignment surgery (SRS), I am obliged to stop taking my hormones. I suddenly feel very differently about my forthcoming operation.”

"Based on my Transgender Journey series for The Guardian, which ran between 2010 and 2012, this memoir combines a personal story of transition with critiques of 1990s and 2000s trans theory, literature and film. It explores the uses of ‘life writing’, the relationship between trans people and feminism, and the tropes that have appeared in media coverage since the 1950s. It includes an Epilogue with Canadian writer Sheila Heti (author of Ticknor and How Should a Person Be?) where she and I discuss the implications of being a ‘transgender writer’, and how the media’s treatment of trans people has changed over the last few years."

Quatrième de couverture :

"In July 2012, aged thirty, Juliet Jacques underwent sex reassignment surgery—a process she chronicled with unflinching honesty in a serialised national newspaper column.

*Trans* tells of her life to the present moment: a story of growing up, of defining yourself, and of the rapidly changing world of gender politics.

Fresh from university, eager to escape a dead-end job, she launches a career as a writer in a publishing culture dominated by London cliques and still figuring out the impact of the Internet. She navigates the treacherous waters of a world where, even in the liberal and feminist media, transgender identities go unacknowledged, misunderstood or worse. Yet through art, film, music, politics and football, Jacques starts to become the person she had only imagined, and begins the process of transition. Interweaving the personal with the political, her memoir is a powerful exploration of debates that comprise trans politics, issues which promise to redefine our understanding of what it means to be alive.

Revealing, honest, humorous, and self-deprecating, *Trans* includes an epilogue with Sheila Heti, author of *How Should a Person Be?*, in which Jacques and Heti discuss the cruxes of writing and identity.
