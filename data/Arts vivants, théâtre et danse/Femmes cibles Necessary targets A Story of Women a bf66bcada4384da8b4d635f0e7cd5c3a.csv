"A propos de la pièce :"
"""La pièce Necessary Targets (Femmes-cibles) s’inspire des histoires des femmes que j’ai rencontrées en Bosnie. Ce sont
leur communauté, le fait qu’elles s’accrochent à l’amour, leur humanité insensée face à la catastrophe, leur refus
bouleversant d’une quelconque vengeance qui m’ont nourrie et finalement poussée à écrire cette pièce."" E. E. (7
femmes)"
"“Ensler tells the story of two American women, a Park Avenue psychiatrist and a human rights worker, who go to Bosniato “help” women confront their memories of war and emerge deeply changed themselves. Necessary Targets is agroundbreaking play about women and war—about the violence of dark memories and the enduring resilience of thehuman spirit."
"Melissa, an ambitious young writer, and J.S., a successful but unsatisfied middle-aged psychiatrist, have nothing in
common beyond the methods they have been taught to distance themselves from other people. As J.S. begins to feel
compassion for the women whose tragedies she has been sent to expose, she turns on Melissa, who finds safety in
control. In an unexpected moment of revelation, J.S. and the women she is supposedly treating find a common ground, a
place to be taught and a place to learn.”"
