"Synopsis :"
"""Why is Justice blind? Is she impartial? Or is she blinkered?"
"Friends Ed and Tim take opposing briefs in a rape case. The key witness is a woman whose life seems a world away
from theirs. At home, their own lives begin to unravel as every version of the truth is challenged."
"Consent, Nina Raine's powerful, painful, funny play, sifts the evidence from every side and puts Justice herself in the
dock."
"Consent premiered at the National Theatre, London, in 2017. It transferred to the Harold Pinter Theatre in London'sWest
End in May 2018. """
